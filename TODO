For a 0.1 version:

* Implement the ideas in the "wishlist" branch
* Get rid of vendor/active_support/callbacks and use Rails' version instead
* Move to Rails 2.2
* Do a bit of a code review, see if the tests could be made any simpler
* Make loads and loads of comments throughout the code, particular in the example app
* Write a good, simple tutorial
* Make a screencast, based on the tutorial
* Release a 0.1 version with a gem, rdoc and a straightforward web page
* Try to promote the plugin a bit and get other developers interested

Future:

* Implement integration testing using Cucumber to test the example app
