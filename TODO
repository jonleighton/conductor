For a 0.1 version:

* Rake task to setup app/conductors directory (should be made a load path too)
* Make a screencast, based on the tutorial
* Release a 0.1 version with a gem, rdoc and a straightforward web page
* Try to promote the plugin a bit and get other developers interested

Future:

* Implement integration testing using Cucumber to test the example app
