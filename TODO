* Get rid of vendor/active_support/callbacks and depend on Rails >= 2.1 instead
* "Updater" is a really bad name - think of something which more accurately describes this class
* Write some helpers to make the necessary view code cleaner
* If we are conducting a habtm association or a through association with no fields on the join model, it should be possible to use a simplified syntax. I.e. has_and_belongs_to_many :tags would allow @conductor.tag_ids = [3, 5, 1] to be managed
